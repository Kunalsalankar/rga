SOLAR PANEL DEFECT KNOWLEDGE BASE (EXAMPLE)

SECTION A: Defect impact (factual)

1) Dusty
- Description: Surface dust or soiling reduces irradiance reaching cells.
- Typical impact: Gradual power loss; may trigger performance ratio drop without immediate electrical hazard.
- Risk notes: Dust accumulation can mask other surface issues; heavy soiling can lead to localized heating under some operating conditions.

2) Bird-drop
- Description: Bird droppings are opaque and may create small shaded regions.
- Typical impact: Disproportionate power loss due to mismatch losses; can create localized hotspots in affected cells.
- Risk notes: Persistent droppings can increase hotspot likelihood compared to uniform dust.

3) Physical-Damage
- Description: Cracks, shattered glass, frame damage, punctures, or broken encapsulation.
- Typical impact: Can lead to moisture ingress and insulation degradation; may cause rapid performance decline.
- Risk notes: May increase electrical safety risk depending on severity and location.

SECTION B: Company maintenance SOP excerpts (example)

SOP-CLEAN-001 (Routine cleaning)
- Scope: Scheduled or ad-hoc cleaning of modules to remove dust/soiling and bird droppings.
- Method: Use deionized water if available; avoid abrasive brushes; clean early morning/evening to reduce thermal stress.
- Post-check: Confirm no residue remains; visually inspect for cracks or delamination.

SOP-INSPECT-002 (Detailed inspection)
- Trigger: Any suspected Physical-Damage or repeated Bird-drop alerts on same panel.
- Method: Visual inspection for cracks, delamination, frame gaps; check connector integrity.
- Safety: Follow lockout/tagout; use insulated gloves when working near live conductors.

SOP-ISOLATE-003 (Electrical isolation)
- Trigger: Confirmed Physical-Damage with potential exposure of conductors or compromised insulation.
- Action (factual): Isolate affected string per site procedure; record string ID and panel location; notify supervisor.

SECTION C: Decision thresholds (example; informational only)

THRESH-DEC-010 (Model confidence usage)
- If primary confidence is low (e.g., < 0.50), treat prediction as uncertain and prioritize retrieving inspection SOP details.
- If top-2 scores are close (e.g., difference < 0.10), retrieve SOPs covering both defects for human review.

THRESH-CLEAN-011 (Cleaning criteria)
- Dusty or Bird-drop predicted with moderate/high confidence: retrieve cleaning SOP and safe cleaning constraints.
- Repeated Dusty alerts over multiple inspections: retrieve scheduling guidance and cleaning frequency policy.

THRESH-DAMAGE-012 (Damage handling)
- Physical-Damage predicted: retrieve inspection and isolation SOPs and required documentation steps.

SECTION D: Documentation requirements (example)

DOC-LOG-020
- Record: panel_id, timestamp, predicted defect, confidence, top-3 predictions, technician notes, actions taken.
- Attach: photos if available (handled outside this RAG module).
