1) Interpretation of ML output
The ML model output for Panel-01 indicates a primary defect of "Dusty" with a confidence score of 0.41. According to company guidelines, if the primary confidence is low (e.g., < 0.50), the prediction should be treated as uncertain [CONTEXT 2]. In this instance, the confidence of 0

.41 is below the 0.50 threshold, which means the prediction for "Dusty" should be treated as uncertain [CONTEXT 2]. Consequently, the immediate next step involves prioritizing the retrieval of inspection SOP details [CONTEXT 2]. The provided context does not include a second confidence score, so it is not possible to assess if the top-2 scores are close, which would
